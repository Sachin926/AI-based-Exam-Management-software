# AI-based-Exam-Management-software
AI based Exam Management software that registers and saves the candidate's database, and at the time of examination AI detects and recognises the candidate's face, automatically recording the attendance and alloting the seats
# OBJECTIVE - 
Due to covid situations it is hard and unsafe for the authorities to conduct In-centre examinations like JEE MAINS and GATE and other exams. The process of allotment seats and identity verification by a examiner before exam is done by the primitive way by individually identifying and alloting the seats to each students which is a quite time taking process and increase the crowd situations as every student is in hurry to get their seat in examination as we have seen in past the rush during the examination which led to violation of covid protocol. So our objective is to design a AI based exam management software to overcome this anomaly.

# IMPLEMENTATION - 
tools used.... 1. Opencv - for collecting database , training AI and detecting face. 2. PyQt5( QT framework ) - for desigining the UI of software. 3. Numpy - for image processing and mathematical manipulations in image. 4. File system database - for database collected. 5. OS module - for data handling and mangement. 6. Py QRcode - for generating QR code for unique identification of each student.

# APPLICATIONS - 
1. AI based Exam Management software that registers and saves the candidate's database 2. At the time of examination AI detects and recognises the candidate's face. 3. Automatically record the attendance and alloting the seats.
